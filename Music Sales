This is the final SQL project I completed using multiple tables showing sales of music tracks and customer information.

/*Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.*/
SELECT firstname, lastname, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

/*Show only the Customers from Brazil.*/
SELECT customerID, firstname, lastname
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

/*Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.*/
SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoiceID, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON c.customerid = i.customerID
WHERE c.country = 'Brazil';

/*Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.*/
SELECT Firstname, Lastname
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';

/* Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.*/
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM invoices;

/*Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.*/
SELECT i.invoiceid, e.employeeid, e.lastname, e.firstname FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

/*Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.*/
SELECT i.total, 
c.firstname AS customer_firstname, 
c.lastname AS customer_lastname, 
c.country, 
e.lastname AS employee_lastname, 
e.firstname AS employee_firstname 
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

/*How many Invoices were there in 2009?*/
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE "2009%";

/*What are the total sales for 2009?*/
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total),2) AS '2009 Total Sales'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE "2009%";

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name FROM invoice_items i
INNER JOIN tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
ORDER BY i.invoicelineid;

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name, t.composer FROM invoice_items i
INNER JOIN tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
ORDER BY i.invoicelineid;

/*Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.*/
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM tracks t
JOIN Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

/*Show the total sales made by each sales agent.*/
SELECT e.employeeid, 
e.firstname, 
e.lastname, 
ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'Total Sales' 
FROM invoices i
JOIN customers c
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
JOIN employees e
ON c.supportrepID = e.employeeid
GROUP BY e.employeeID;

/*Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?*/
SELECT e.employeeid,
e.firstname,
e.lastname,
ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS '2009 Sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
AND e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.employeeid
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) DESC
LIMIT 1;
